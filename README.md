# Numerical Analysis Projects
---

This repository contains solutions for various assignments from a "Numerical Analysis" course which is conducted at Ben Gurion University. The projects involve implementing numerical algorithms using Python while avoiding built-in methods for key operations, following the course guidelines.

### Description of Assignments:
➢ **Assignment 1**: <u>Interpolation with Cubic Bezier Curves</u> - Implements a linear spline interpolation algorithm, testing against polynomials and other functions.

➢ **Assignment 2**: <u>Finding Intersections using the Bisection Method</u> - Finds the intersection points between two given functions within a specified error margin.

➢ **Assignment 3**: <u>Numerical integration and area between curves</u> - Computes numerical integrals and calculates the area between two functions over a defined range.

➢ **Assignment 4**: <u>Polynomial fitting for noisy data</u> - Fits noisy data to a polynomial function using least squares.

➢ **Assignment 5**: Calculating areas of complex shapes - Approximates the area of a complex shape using the shoelace method and adaptive sampling.

## Course Guidelines:
- No usage of built-in methods for root-finding, interpolation, matrix decomposition, or solving linear systems.
- All solutions must pass unit tests provided within the assignment files.

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher  
- Anaconda distribution (recommended)  
- Libraries: 
  - `numpy` (limited usage allowed)
  - `pytorch` (optional for certain tasks)

### Running the Code:
 Run the individual assignments:
   ```
